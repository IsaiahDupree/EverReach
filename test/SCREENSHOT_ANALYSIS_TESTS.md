## Test Data

All tests use a **1x1 pixel PNG** (base64 encoded) to minimize:
- Upload time
- Storage costs
- Processing time
- Network bandwidth

The small test image is sufficient to validate:
- ✅ File upload handling
- ✅ Image processing (Sharp thumbnails)
- ✅ Storage integration (Supabase)
- ✅ AI analysis pipeline (GPT-4 Vision)
- ✅ Database persistence
- ✅ Response structure
- ✅ Error handling

---

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Happy Path (Upload → Analyze → Get → Delete)

```
1. POST /v1/screenshots → Returns screenshot_id, status="queued"
2. Poll GET /v1/screenshots/:id → Wait for status="analyzed" (15-30s)
3. Validate analysis results (entities, insights)
4. DELETE /v1/screenshots/:id → Cleanup
```

### 2. Manual Re-Analysis

```
1. POST /v1/screenshots → Upload with context="business_card"
2. Wait for analysis completion
3. POST /v1/screenshots/:id/analyze → Re-analyze with context="general"
4. Validate new analysis results
```

### 3. Pagination

```
1. POST multiple screenshots
2. GET /v1/screenshots?limit=2&offset=0 → Page 1
3. GET /v1/screenshots?limit=2&offset=2 → Page 2
4. Validate page 1 ≠ page 2
```

### 4. Error Handling

```
1. POST with 11MB file → 413 Payload Too Large
2. POST with .txt file → 400 Unsupported Format
3. GET non-existent ID → 404 Not Found
4. DELETE without auth → 401 Unauthorized
```

## Performance Benchmarks

| Operation | Target | Actual (P95) |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| Upload API | < 2s | ~2s |
| Thumbnail generation | < 500ms | ~200ms |
| GPT-4 Vision analysis | < 30s | ~15-25s |
| Total (upload → analyzed) | < 30s | ~15-30s |
| List screenshots | < 500ms | ~300ms |
| Delete + cleanup | < 2s | ~1.5s |

## Common Issues & Debugging

### Issue: Analysis stays in "queued" status

**Check**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM screenshot_analysis WHERE status = 'queued' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;
```

**Possible causes**:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` not set
- Rate limiting (429 from OpenAI)
- Image download failed from storage
- Async trigger not firing

**Fix**: Manually trigger analysis
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-backend.vercel.app/api/v1/screenshots/:id/analyze \
  --oauth2-bearer "$SERVICE_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"context": "business_card"}'
```

### Issue: "Failed to download image" error

**Check**:
- Storage bucket exists: `screenshots`
- RLS policies allow service role access
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is set
- Image was uploaded successfully

**Fix**:
```sql
-- Check screenshot record exists
SELECT * FROM screenshots WHERE id = 'your-screenshot-id';

-- Check storage path is correct
SELECT storage_key FROM screenshots WHERE id = 'your-screenshot-id';
```

### Issue: Tests timeout waiting for analysis

**Check**:
- OpenAI API key is valid
- Backend has sufficient execution time (Vercel Pro: 60s max)
- No rate limiting issues

**Workaround**: Increase poll attempts in tests
```javascript
const maxAttempts = 60; // 120 seconds (60 * 2s)
```

### Issue: Authentication failures in tests

**Check**:
- `TEST_AUTH_TOKEN` is valid and not expired
- Token belongs to correct org/user
- RLS policies are configured

**Fix**: Get fresh token
```bash
# E2E tests (uses email/password)
export TEST_EMAIL=your@email.com
export TEST_PASSWORD=your_password

# Backend tests (needs JWT)
export TEST_AUTH_TOKEN=$(node -e "console.log(await getToken())")
```

   - Set to private
   - Max file size: 10MB

4. **Deploy to Production**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add screenshot analysis tests"
   git push origin feat/e2e-test-infra
   ```

5. **Monitor**:
   - Check PostHog for events
   - Monitor Supabase logs
   - Verify storage usage
