## 1. The Core Mechanism

**This is the single idea that makes everything fit together.**

> People don't fail relationships from lack of love.
> They fail from lack of a system.
> **EverReach = a personal CRM that turns "care" into a repeatable rhythm.**
> (reminders + last touch + message starters)

That's the unique mechanism. Every ad you make is selling one belief first:

> *"Relationships aren't just vibes — they're a system."*
> Then EverReach is the simplest implementation of that belief.

In Schwartz terms:
- **Unaware** people want a truth, not a tool
- **Problem-aware** people want the enemy named
- **Solution-aware** people want the mechanism
- **Product-aware** people want proof
- **Most-aware** people want objection removal

---

## 2. Eugene Schwartz Awareness Ladder

The most important framework in direct response. Every ad must match the awareness level of the audience seeing it. Running the wrong ad to the wrong stage kills performance.

```
STAGE 1 — UNAWARE
"I didn't know this was a problem"
→ Lead with truth/emotion. No product. No features.
→ Goal: create recognition + emotional resonance
→ CTA: save / send / comment (NOT download)

STAGE 2 — PROBLEM AWARE
"I feel this pain but don't know the solution"
→ Name the enemy clearly (drift, no system, memory fails)
→ Agitate the problem, then hint at relief
→ CTA: comment keyword for templates/plan

STAGE 3 — SOLUTION AWARE
"I know a solution exists, I'm evaluating options"
→ Introduce the mechanism (rhythm + list + starters)
→ Show the system, not the app yet
→ CTA: comment for the method / follow for part 4

STAGE 4 — PRODUCT AWARE
"I know EverReach exists, I'm not sure it's for me"
→ Demo 3 features → 1 outcome
→ Show proof fast (screen recording)
→ CTA: download / start trial

STAGE 5 — MOST AWARE
"I've seen EverReach, I have objections"
→ Kill objections directly (not spammy, cancel anytime, your circle)
→ Reduce friction, increase trust
→ CTA: start free trial, no pressure
```

**Organic content** lives at Stage 1–2. This is where reach and saves happen.
**Paid retargeting** lives at Stage 3–5. This is where installs and trials happen.

## 3. The Universal Ad Skeleton (15–30s)

Works on Meta Reels, TikTok-style, and App Store preview. Every script follows this beat structure:

```
BEAT 1 — HOOK (0–2s)
Pattern break. Curiosity or relief. Win the first seconds.
Design for sound-off: captions must carry the hook.

BEAT 2 — MIRROR (2–5s)
"You've felt this." Familiarity. Make them nod.
No selling yet. Just recognition.

BEAT 3 — NAME THE ENEMY (5–8s)
Drift. No system. Memory fails when life gets loud.
Give the problem a name so it feels solvable.

BEAT 4 — MECHANISM (8–15s)
The rhythm system: list + reminder + starters.
This is the "how" — not the app, the principle.

BEAT 5 — PROOF (15–22s)
Show the app doing the thing.
Screen recording > talking about features.

BEAT 6 — CTA (last 2–4s)
Start trial / Download free / Comment keyword.
One action only. Never stack CTAs.
```

**Shot type rules:**
- **A-roll:** You talking (trust / identity)
- **B-roll:** Phone screen recording (proof)
- **Overlay:** Big on-screen text (hook + steps)
- **Micro-demo:** 1 feature per beat (never cram multiple features in one shot)

**Rule:** Every sentence gets a matching shot. No "talking into air."

## 4. Framework Scripts + Shot Lists by Stage

---

### Stage 1 — UNAWARE (15s) | "Truth First"

**Goal:** Stop scroll + create emotional recognition. No features. No app until the very end.
You are creating demand before selling.

**Script:**
```
0–2s:   most friendships don't end they drift
2–5s:   you care you just get busy and time disappears
5–9s:   the goal isn't to catch up it's to make the next message normal again
9–12s:  that takes a rhythm not motivation
12–15s: i built a simple system for that link in bio
```

**Shot List:**
```
0–2s:   Bold text on screen, hard cut. No face yet.
2–5s:   Your face, calm "relief" tone, direct to camera.
5–9s:   Overlay text: "make the next message normal again"
9–12s:  Quick list graphic: "rhythm beats effort"
12–15s: 1-second app flash + "start free trial" text
```

**Why it works:** Unaware needs meaning + emotion first, then a hint of solution. The app is a whisper, not a shout.

---

### Stage 2 — PROBLEM AWARE (20s) | PAS Framework

**Goal:** They already feel the pain. Name it precisely, agitate it, then offer relief.

**Script:**
```
0–2s:   the longer you wait the more awkward it feels
2–6s:   then you overthink then you send nothing
6–9s:   and months turn into distance
9–14s:  so here's the fix — a tiny check in rhythm plus message starters
14–20s: i use a personal crm that reminds me who to check in on
        and gives me the words — start free trial today
```

**Shot List:**
```
0–2s:   Hook text + quick zoom on face
2–6s:   "Overthinking" visual — typing bubble appearing and deleting
6–9s:   Calendar pages flipping (time passing)
9–14s:  Whiteboard or text overlay: "3 steps"
14–20s: Screen recording: last touch → tap → message starter → send
```

**Why it works:** Pain is vivid and specific, then the system appears as relief — not as a product pitch.

---

### Stage 3 — SOLUTION AWARE (25s) | AIDA Framework

**Goal:** Viewer is open to "how" and needs a clear path from concept to action.

**Script:**
```
Attention: stop doing relationships from memory
Interest:  memory fails when life gets loud
Desire:    here's the rhythm — top people list, weekly rotation, and starters
Action:    download everreach — start your free trial
```

**Shot List:**
```
Attention: You + text overlay "stop doing relationships from memory"
Interest:  Quick montage of busy life (notifications, calendar, messages)
Desire:    3 screen-record clips: list → reminder → starter
Action:    App Store page + "start trial" text
```

**Why it works:** Moves cleanly from concept → mechanism → action. AIDA is the right structure when the viewer is already open to a solution.

---

### Stage 4 — PRODUCT AWARE (30s) | "3 Features → 1 Outcome"

**Goal:** They already suspect EverReach might work. Show proof fast. Reduce risk.

**Script:**
```
0–2s:   if you want to stay close without overthinking this is the tool
2–10s:  feature one — top people list and warmth score
10–18s: feature two — last touch and gentle reminders
18–24s: feature three — message starters when your brain is blank
24–30s: the goal isn't to catch up
        it's to make the next message normal again
        start free trial
```

**Shot List:**
```
0–2s:   App UI teaser (warmth grid visible)
2–10s:  Screen recording: contact list + warmth score
10–18s: Screen recording: reminder ping + tap to open
18–24s: Screen recording: starter selection + send
24–30s: Thesis text overlay + CTA button
```

**Why it works:** Product-aware needs reduced risk + clarity. Three concrete features → one emotional payoff.

---

### Stage 5 — MOST AWARE (30s) | 4Cs Framework

**Goal:** Kill objections. Use 4Cs as the final filter: Clear, Concise, Compelling, Credible.

**Script:**
```
0–3s:   this is not spammy it's a reminder to be human
3–10s:  you choose your circle and how often you want to check in
10–18s: it gives you starters so it never feels awkward
18–24s: cancel anytime no pressure
24–30s: start the free trial and see if it fits
```

**Shot List:**
```
0–3s:   Direct-to-camera reassurance (warm, not salesy)
3–10s:  Settings screen showing cadence control (your choice, your circle)
10–18s: Starters screen — showing options, not forcing
18–24s: Paywall screen: "cancel anytime" visible
24–30s: CTA overlay + app icon
```

**Why it works:** Most-aware viewers have seen the product and have specific objections. Address them directly. Don't re-sell the concept.

## 5. The FATE Creative Stack

Every ad that converts does these four things. Use this as a checklist before publishing.

```
F — FAMILIARITY
"You've felt this."
The viewer must recognize themselves in the first 5 seconds.
Without familiarity, nothing else lands.

A — AUTHORITY
"I built a system for this."
You're not just sharing a feeling — you have a method.
Authority comes from specificity, not credentials.

T — TRUST
Show the template / list / app screen.
Trust is built by showing, not telling.
Screen recordings > testimonials > talking about features.

E — EMOTION
Relief + hope + identity.
The identity shift: "I'm the type of person who shows up for people."
This is what makes someone save, share, and eventually download.
```

---

## 6. AIDA / PAS / 4Cs Reference

### AIDA (Solution-Aware → Product-Aware)
```
A — Attention:   Pattern interrupt. Stop the scroll.
I — Interest:    Relevant problem or insight. "This is about me."
D — Desire:      Show the mechanism or outcome. "I want that."
A — Action:      Single clear CTA. "Here's what to do next."
```
**Best for:** Stage 3–4. Viewer is open to a solution and needs a clear path.

---

### PAS (Problem-Aware)
```
P — Problem:    Name the exact pain. Be specific.
A — Agitate:    Make the pain feel real and urgent.
S — Solution:   Introduce the relief. Don't over-explain.
```
**Best for:** Stage 2. Viewer feels the pain but hasn't found a solution.

---

### 4Cs (Most-Aware / Objection Removal)
```
C — Clear:      No ambiguity. Exactly what it does.
C — Concise:    No wasted words. Every sentence earns its place.
C — Compelling: Specific benefit or outcome. Not vague.
C — Credible:   Proof, specificity, or social trust.
```
**Best for:** Stage 5. Viewer has objections. Kill them cleanly.

---

## 7. Full-Funnel Campaign Architecture

### Meta

```
TOF (Top of Funnel) — Video Views / Engagement
  → "Adult-life truth" reels (Stage 1–2)
  → Cheap distribution. Build the audience.
  → CTA: save / comment / follow (NOT download)
  → Creative: Unaware truth + Problem-aware

MOF (Middle of Funnel) — App Promotion → Install / Trial Start
  → Retarget 25%+ video viewers
  → Creative: System reveal + Product proof
  → CTA: "Get the system" / "Download free"

BOF (Bottom of Funnel) — App Event Optimization → Subscribe
  → Retarget MOF clickers + App Store visitors
  → Creative: Objection killers + Demo
  → CTA: "Start free trial" / "Cancel anytime"
```

### Apple Ads (High-Intent — Run Separately)

High-intent searches: "personal CRM", "relationship tracker", "contact reminders", "follow up app"

**Custom Product Page (CPP) themes:**

| CPP | Keyword Theme | Screenshot 1 | Screenshot 2 | Screenshot 3 |
|-----|--------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | friends + family | "stay close" outcome | list + reminders | message starters |
| 2 | networking | "follow up" | warmth score | AI compose |
| 3 | dating / crush | "warmth / consistency" | starters | reminders |
| 4 | clients / work | "don't drop the ball" | last touch | update templates |

### The Master Blueprint (If You Do Only One Thing)

```
1. Run your best unaware reels as TOF (views/engagement)
2. Retarget 25%+ viewers with "system reveal"
3. Retarget clickers with app demo + trial
4. Apple Ads captures high-intent searches (separate channel)
```

That's the cleanest path from "viral feel" → "subscription revenue."

---

## 8. Creative Volume & Testing Loop

### Minimum Viable Creative Volume

```
TOF videos (Stage 1–2):   6–10 videos, 10–30s each
MOF videos (Stage 3–4):   4–6 videos, 15–35s each
BOF demos (Stage 4–5):    3–5 videos, 10–20s each
Static variants:          3 images (simple text + screenshot)
```

### Testing Rules

- **Test hooks, not entire scripts**
- **One variable at a time:**
  - Hook text
  - First 2 seconds (face vs. b-roll vs. text)
  - Offer framing (templates vs. trial)
  - Proof type (screen recording vs. story)

### Weekly Cadence

```
Week 1: Find 2–3 winning TOF creatives (cheap reach)
Week 2: Retarget viewers with MOF "system reveal"
Week 3: Retarget MOF engagers with BOF demo + trial
Week 4: Scale winners, refresh hooks
```

### Metrics That Actually Matter

| Funnel | Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|--------|
| TOF | 3-second view rate | > 40% |
| TOF | Shares / saves | Maximize |
| MOF | CTR | > 1.5% |
| MOF | Cost per install | < $3.00 |
| BOF | Cost per trial start | Track |
| BOF | Cost per subscribe | Track |

## 9. Measurement Foundation

### Meta App Promotion Setup Checklist

- [ ] Meta App exists in Facebook Developer settings (bundle ID: `com.everreach.app`)
- [ ] Meta App ID `453049510987286` linked to ad account
- [ ] iOS campaign configured for SKAdNetwork (privacy-era attribution)
- [ ] App Install events firing correctly (verify in Events Manager)
- [ ] Pixel `10039038026189444` active for web retargeting
- [ ] Conversions API token active (non-expiring, from Events Manager → Settings)

### iOS Attribution Reality (2026)

SKAdNetwork is foundational for iOS install measurement on Meta. You will **not** get perfect device-level attribution due to ATT.

**Practical approach:**
- Optimize on: installs → trial starts → subscribe
- Accept delayed/aggregated reporting (don't panic early — wait 3–5 days)
- Apple Ads uses AdAttributionKit (registered April 10, 2025) — privacy-shaped but still high-intent

### Signal Quality Ladder

```
Best:       Subscribe / purchase event
Good:       Trial start
Acceptable: App install
Weak:       App Store view
```

## 10. Common Failure Points

| Failure | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| "application_id invalid" campaign error | App not linked as Meta App, or bundle ID mismatch | Verify Meta App ID `453049510987286` is linked to ad account |
| iOS attribution confusion | SKAdNetwork delay + aggregation | Wait 3–5 days before judging. Don't optimize on day-1 data. |
| Creative mismatch | Running "download now" ads to cold audiences | Keep TOF pure — no product pitch, no download CTA |
| Stacking CTAs | Asking for follow + comment + save + download in one video | One CTA per video. Match to funnel stage. |
| EverReach name in Stage 1–3 | Mentioning app too early kills organic reach | EverReach only in Part 4 and pinned comment |
| Testing entire scripts | Changing too many variables at once | Keep body identical. Only swap first 2 seconds. |
