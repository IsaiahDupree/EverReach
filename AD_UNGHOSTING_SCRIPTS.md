## 1. Series Logic

**7 categories × 3 parts = 21 videos.**

| Part | Schwartz Stage | What It Does | EverReach Name? |
|------|---------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Part 1 | Unaware | Truth/emotion. No system. No app. | ❌ Never |
| Part 2 | Problem-Aware | Name the enemy. PAS structure. | ❌ Never |
| Part 3 | Solution-Aware | The method. The system. | ❌ Never |
| Part 4 | Product-Aware | EverReach demo. Screen recording. | ✅ Yes |

**Rule:** EverReach name only appears in Part 4 or the pinned comment. Keep Parts 1–3 clean — this protects organic reach and makes the content feel like advice, not an ad.

**7 Categories:**
1. Un-ghosting a friend
2. Un-ghosting family
3. Un-ghosting a client
4. Un-ghosting a mentor
5. Un-ghosting a crush
6. Un-ghosting coworkers / colleagues
7. Un-ghosting an old friend (years later)

## 2. The 21 Scripts

All scripts are voice-text ready — no punctuation, all lowercase, natural speech rhythm.

---

### Category 1: Un-Ghosting a Friend

**Part 1 — Unaware** *(already done — best performer)*
```
most friendships don't end they drift
you care you just get busy and time disappears
the goal isn't to catch up it's to make the next message normal again
that takes a rhythm not motivation
i built a simple system for that link in bio
```

**Part 2 — Problem Aware**
```
you are not a bad friend
you are just doing friendship from memory
and memory fails when life gets loud
so weeks turn into months
and months turn into awkward
and here is where it gets interesting
the problem is not effort
the problem is no rhythm
comment rhythm and i will drop my friend check in plan
```

**Part 3 — Solution Aware**
```
here is the simple system i use
pick your top five people
give each person one tiny lane
one person gets a weekly two minute check in
one person gets a meme
one person gets a voice note
then rotate one per week
and here is where it gets interesting
tiny repeats beat big catch ups
comment list and i will share message starters
```

---

### Category 2: Un-Ghosting Family

**Part 1 — Unaware**
```
most family distance is not conflict
it is drift
you love them you just stopped having a rhythm
and adult life fills every gap before you notice
the goal is not a big catch up call
the goal is one tiny message that feels normal
i have a system for that link in bio
```

**Part 2 — Problem Aware**
```
family guilt hits different
because you think it should be automatic
but adult life steals attention every day
so you wait for the perfect time
and the perfect time never comes
and here is where it gets interesting
most family distance is not conflict
it is drift
comment family if you want my easiest check in method
```

**Part 3 — Solution Aware**
```
here is the method
choose three family members
set one recurring tiny check in day
keep the message the same format every time
thinking of you today how are you really
then once a month send one photo or memory
and here is where it gets interesting
predictable warmth feels like love
comment family and i will drop templates
```

---

### Category 3: Un-Ghosting a Client

**Part 1 — Unaware**
```
the best clients don't leave because of bad work
they leave because of silence
and silence makes people imagine the worst
the fix is not a long apology
it is one clear message that shows you are on it
i have a three line system for that link in bio
```

**Part 2 — Problem Aware**
```
clients do not get mad at silence first
they get confused
then they lose trust
because silence makes them imagine the worst
and here is where it gets interesting
apologies do not rebuild trust
clarity does
comment client and i will drop my cleanest update templates
```

**Part 3 — Solution Aware**
```
use this three line system
line one quick update
line two next step
line three delivery time
hey quick update i am doing x next step is y you will have it by z
and here is where it gets interesting
certainty calms people down
comment client for my copy paste scripts
```

---

### Category 4: Un-Ghosting a Mentor

**Part 1 — Unaware**
```
the reason you stop reaching out to your mentor is not ingratitude
it is pressure
you think you need a big impressive update before you can reach out
so you wait
and waiting turns into distance
the fix is one sentence not a report
i have the format link in bio
```

**Part 2 — Problem Aware**
```
the reason you avoid your mentor is not disrespect
it is pressure
you think you need a big impressive update
so you delay
and here is where it gets interesting
mentors do not want perfection
they want progress
comment mentor and i will give you the easiest outreach format
```

**Part 3 — Solution Aware**
```
use the gratitude update question format
thank you again for x
quick update i tried it and here is what happened
can i ask one quick question about y
and here is where it gets interesting
one good question keeps the relationship alive
comment mentor for templates
```

---

### Category 5: Un-Ghosting a Crush

**Part 1 — Unaware**
```
the reason you haven't texted them is not that you don't care
it is that you care too much
so you overthink every word
and send nothing
the goal is not the perfect message
the goal is one easy line they can actually reply to
i have three of those link in bio
```

**Part 2 — Problem Aware**
```
the real reason you ghost a crush is fear of looking dumb
so you overthink the message
then you send nothing
and here is where it gets interesting
the longer you wait the more pressure you create
comment smooth if you want low pressure openers
```

**Part 3 — Solution Aware**
```
use the light specific easy reply format
one light line
two specific reference
three easy question
yo this made me laugh i thought of you how is your week going
and here is where it gets interesting
easy questions get answers
heavy messages get ignored
comment smooth for templates
```

---

### Category 6: Un-Ghosting Coworkers / Colleagues

**Part 1 — Unaware**
```
your best career opportunities will not come from job boards
they will come from people who already know you
but work relationships fade because there is no default rhythm
the fix is not networking events
it is one small message every few weeks
i have the format link in bio
```

**Part 2 — Problem Aware**
```
work relationships fade because there is no default rhythm
everyone assumes they will reconnect later
then later becomes never
and here is where it gets interesting
your network is built in the small moments
not when you need something
comment coworker if you want a simple check in script
```

**Part 3 — Solution Aware**
```
use the value ping format
one compliment
two quick question
three offer help
hey i liked how you handled x how is y going anything i can help with
and here is where it gets interesting
being useful makes you unforgettable
comment coworker for templates
```

---

### Category 7: Un-Ghosting an Old Friend (Years Later)

**Part 1 — Unaware**
```
you are not avoiding them
you are avoiding the emotion
because reaching out after years feels like reopening a whole era
but here is what i know
they have probably thought about you too
and the message does not have to explain everything
it just has to start
i have the opener link in bio
```

**Part 2 — Problem Aware**
```
you are not avoiding them
you are avoiding the emotion
because reaching out feels like reopening a whole era
and here is where it gets interesting
nostalgia is the bridge
not the burden
comment old friend if you want my safest openers
```

**Part 3 — Solution Aware**
```
use the memory bridge format
one name the memory
two share why you thought of them
three ask one small question
hey this is random but i remembered x today and it made me smile how have you been
and here is where it gets interesting
memories make the message feel natural
comment old friend for templates
```

## 3. Part 4 Product-Aware Blueprint (Reusable)

**Use this structure for every category's Part 4. Swap the hook to match the category. Always use screen recording.**

```
HOOK (swap per category):
if you are tired of doing relationships from memory

SHOW SCREEN:
this is how i keep it simple

FEATURE 1:
top people list

FEATURE 2:
last touch and gentle reminders

FEATURE 3:
message starters so it never feels awkward

PAYOFF:
the goal is not to catch up on everything
the goal is to make the next message normal again

CTA:
download everreach and start your free trial
```

**Category-specific hooks for Part 4:**

| Category | Hook |
|----------|------|
| Friend | if you want to stop doing friendship from memory |
| Family | if family drift feels like your fault but you don't know how to fix it |
| Client | if you want to never go silent on a client again |
| Mentor | if you want to stay on your mentor's radar without being annoying |
| Crush | if you want to stay warm without overthinking every message |
| Coworker | if you want your network to remember you before you need something |
| Old friend | if you want to restart an old friendship without making it weird |

**Pinned comment that bridges unaware → product (use on all Part 1–3 videos):**
> if you want my full message starter pack and the system i use to remember who to check in on it is in my bio

## 4. Caption + Title + Description System

### What We Learned from Best Performers

**Winning ingredients (from post performance data):**
- Relief first, not shame
- A hidden rule nobody says out loud
- 3 tiny steps
- One copy-paste line people can use immediately
- A thesis that feels like philosophy
- Save / comment / follow CTAs outperform hard sell

**Translation:**
- Titles should promise a rule or shortcut
- Captions should feel like a friend handing you a cheat code
- Descriptions invite a micro action + a comment keyword

---

### The 3 Text Assets (Generate Every Time)

#### A) Video Title
For YouTube Shorts and internal filename.

**Formulas:**
```
the rule nobody says about [x]
the simplest way to [x]
stop doing [x] do this instead
[x] isn't hard you just need a rhythm
[x] in 10 seconds
```

**Rules:**
- 35–60 characters
- One strong idea
- Avoid vague words: mindset, tips, growth

---

#### B) Instagram Caption
Short, punchy, all lowercase.

**Formula:**
```
[hook line — emotional, not an introduction]
[one insight line]
[one actionable line]
[comment keyword line]
[optional bio line]
```

**Rules:**
- First line = emotional hook (relief or curiosity)
- Never start with "I" or the app name (for stages 1–3)
- One primary CTA only — never stack save + comment + follow

---

#### C) Description
Works for YouTube Short description and IG.

**Formula:**
```
[1 line summary of the pain]
[1 line of the method]
[1 line of the template / copy-paste line]
[comment keyword]
[soft bio CTA]
```

---

### Funnel-Aligned CTAs

**Unaware video:**
- `save this for the next time you hesitate`
- `send this to the friend you keep thinking about`
- `comment list and i'll drop templates`

**Problem-aware video:**
- `comment system and i'll share the method`
- `comment rhythm and i'll send the plan`
- `if you want the template pack it's in my bio`

**Solution-aware video:**
- `comment list for the starters`
- `comment rhythm for the check in schedule`
- `follow for part 4 where i show the tool`

**Product-aware video:**
- `download everreach and start your trial`
- `link in bio to get the system`
- `subscribe if you want the reminders and starters built in`

---

### Generator Rules (Follow Every Time)

| Rule | What to Do |
|------|-----------|
| **Rule 1** | Titles: 35–60 chars, one strong idea, no vague words |
| **Rule 2** | Captions must start with relief or curiosity — not an introduction |
| **Rule 3** | Include one copy-paste line in the description |
| **Rule 4** | One keyword CTA only — never stack multiple asks |
| **Rule 5** | Keep EverReach out of caption unless it's product-aware (Part 4 only) |

---

## 5. Reusable Caption Pack

### Hook Lines (Caption Openers)
```
there's a rule nobody says out loud
the longer you wait the harder it feels
most friendships don't end they just drift
closeness isn't found it's built
guilt is proof you care not proof you failed
you're not a bad friend you're just doing it from memory
the problem isn't effort it's no rhythm
you are not avoiding them you are avoiding the emotion
```

### Thesis Lines (The Philosophy)
```
the goal isn't to catch up it's to make the next message normal again
you're not late you're restarting the rhythm
tiny repeats beat big catch ups
trust is patterns not promises
rhythm beats effort
predictable warmth feels like love
being useful makes you unforgettable
nostalgia is the bridge not the burden
certainty calms people down
easy questions get answers heavy messages get ignored
```

### Comment Keywords (That Convert)

| Keyword | What You Send Back |
|---------|-------------------|
| `list` | message starter templates |
| `rhythm` | check in plan / schedule |
| `system` | the full method |
| `friend` | friend check in templates |
| `family` | family check in templates |
| `client` | client update scripts |
| `mentor` | mentor outreach format |
| `smooth` | crush / low-pressure openers |
| `coworker` | colleague value ping scripts |
| `old friend` | memory bridge openers |
