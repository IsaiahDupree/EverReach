### Headline
**The Hidden Cost of Forgotten Connections**

### Body Copy
You have hundreds of valuable relationships, but life gets busy. Important contacts slip through the cracks. Opportunities fade. Networks go cold.

**The result?**
- Lost business opportunities worth thousands
- Weakened professional networks
- Damaged personal relationships
- Constant anxiety about who you're forgetting

**Traditional CRMs don't help** — they're complex, time-consuming, and designed for sales teams, not relationship builders.

- Multi-channel support (Email, SMS, DM)
- Goal-based composition (networking, follow-up, business)
- Learns your writing style and tone

#### 📸 Screenshot Intelligence

## FAQ Section

### General Questions

**Q: How is EverReach different from a traditional CRM?**
A: Traditional CRMs are built for sales teams tracking transactions. EverReach is built for humans maintaining relationships. We focus on who you know, not what you sell.

**Q: How does the Warmth Score work?**
A: Our proprietary algorithm uses exponential decay to track relationship health. Every interaction warms up a contact. Over time, without interaction, the score naturally decays. You can customize decay rates based on relationship importance.

**Q: Is my data secure?**
A: Absolutely. We use enterprise-grade encryption, regular security audits, and comply with GDPR/CCPA. Your data is yours — we never sell or share it with third parties.

**Q: Can I import contacts from other platforms?**
A: Yes! Import from Google Contacts, phone contacts, CSV files, or by uploading business cards. Our AI handles the rest.

**Q: How accurate is the AI message generation?**
A: Our AI analyzes your entire relationship history, writing style, and contact context to generate messages that sound authentically like you. Most users send AI-generated messages with minimal editing.

### Pricing & Plans

**Q: What happens after my free trial?**
A: You can continue with the free Starter plan (50 contacts) or upgrade to unlock unlimited contacts and advanced features.

**Q: Can I cancel anytime?**
A: Yes. No contracts, no cancellation fees. Cancel anytime from your account settings.

**Q: Do you offer refunds?**
A: Yes. If you're not satisfied within the first 30 days, we'll refund you in full.

### Technical Questions

**Q: Is there a mobile app?**
A: Yes! EverReach is available on iOS and Android, with full feature parity across mobile and web.

**Q: Does it integrate with my email?**
A: Yes. We integrate with Gmail, Outlook, and other major email providers to automatically track interactions.
