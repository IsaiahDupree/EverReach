## 3. Marketing Angles (9 Core)

### Angle 1: "The Forgotten Follow-Up" (Fear/Loss)

**Emotion:** Anxiety / FOMO | **Target:** All ICPs

The cost of forgetting is visceral. Most professionals lose deals not because they don't care — but because they forget. Make that cost real.

**Key Messages:**
- "That investor you met at the conference? They signed with someone else."
- "Your best client went quiet 3 months ago. You never noticed."
- "The follow-up you forgot cost you more than you think."

**Arc:** Guilt → Recognition → Relief (EverReach fixes this)

---

### Angle 2: "Warmth Score" (Curiosity/Novelty)

**Emotion:** Curiosity | **Target:** Tech-forward founders, sales pros

The Warmth Score is genuinely novel. Nobody else shows a real-time health score for every relationship. Lead with the visual — the color-coded grid from Hot to Cold — and let curiosity drive the install.

**Key Messages:**
- "Every relationship has a score. Most people have no idea."
- "See which contacts are going cold — before it's too late."
- "Hot. Warm. Neutral. Cool. Cold. Which are yours?"

**Arc:** Curiosity → Desire to know → Download to find out

---

### Angle 3: "3-Minute Daily Routine" (Ease/Habit)

**Emotion:** Relief / Aspiration | **Target:** Busy founders, consultants, sales pros

People know they should maintain their network. They don't because it feels overwhelming. Reframe it as a simple daily habit — like brushing your teeth for your relationships.

**Key Messages:**
- "3 minutes a day is all it takes to keep your entire network warm."
- "The most successful people have a relationship routine. Here's theirs."
- "Stop letting your network decay. 3 minutes fixes it."

**Arc:** Overwhelm → Simplicity → Aspiration

---

### Angle 4: "AI That Sounds Like You" (Skepticism Flip)

**Emotion:** Skepticism → Surprise → Desire | **Target:** Sales pros, founders who've tried AI tools

Most people have tried AI writing tools and found them generic. Directly address that objection and flip it — EverReach's AI uses your full relationship history, notes, and context to write messages that are genuinely personalized.

**Key Messages:**
- "AI messages that use your history, your tone, your context."
- "Not 'Dear [First Name].' Actually personal."
- "The AI reads your last 6 months of notes before it writes a word."

**Arc:** Skepticism → Proof → Desire

---

### Angle 5: "Card Scan in 3 Seconds" (Demo/Speed)

**Emotion:** Delight / Efficiency | **Target:** Event networkers, sales pros, real estate

Pure demo angle. The screenshot/card scan feature is visually compelling and immediately understandable. Show it happening in real time. No explanation needed.

**Key Messages:**
- "Snap a photo. Contact created. Done."
- "Never lose a business card again."
- "From conference to CRM in 3 seconds."

**Arc:** Attention → Delight → "I need this"

---

### Angle 6: "Your Network Is Your Net Worth" (Aspiration/Identity)

**Emotion:** Aspiration / Identity | **Target:** Founders, ambitious professionals

Speaks to identity — the kind of person who is intentional about relationships. Aspirational, not fear-based. Positions EverReach as the tool serious professionals use.

**Key Messages:**
- "Top founders don't leave relationships to chance."
- "Your network is your most valuable asset. Treat it like one."
- "The people who win in business are the ones who stay warm."

**Arc:** Aspiration → Identity alignment → Action

---

### Angle 7: "Before / After" (Transformation)

**Emotion:** Recognition → Hope | **Target:** All ICPs

Classic direct response. Show the messy before (spreadsheets, forgotten follow-ups, cold pipeline) vs. the clean after (warmth grid, AI messages, 3-min routine).

**Before:** Contacts scattered, forgotten follow-ups, blank-page anxiety, cold pipeline
**After:** Real-time warmth scores, AI tells you who to contact, messages in 10 seconds, 3-min habit

---

### Angle 8: "Switcher" (Comparison)

**Emotion:** Frustration → Relief | **Target:** HubSpot/Salesforce users, Notion/spreadsheet users

Enterprise CRMs are overkill for personal relationship management. Position EverReach as the right tool for human relationships.

**Key Messages:**
- "Salesforce tracks deals. EverReach tracks people."
- "Your spreadsheet doesn't know who's going cold."
- "5-minute setup. No IT department required."

**Arc:** Frustration → Recognition → Relief

---

### Angle 9: "Voice Notes" (Unique Feature / Delight)

**Emotion:** Delight / Curiosity | **Target:** Mobile-first, on-the-go professionals

Record a thought after a meeting, EverReach transcribes it, extracts action items, and logs the interaction. Show this happening in a demo.

**Key Messages:**
- "Just finished a meeting? Talk. EverReach handles the rest."
- "Record a voice note. Get a transcription, action items, and a logged interaction."
- "Your CRM that listens."

**Arc:** Curiosity → Delight → "I need this in my life"

|--------------|----------|
| Angle | 9 angles (run top 4 first) |

### Phase 3: Optimization (Week 5+)
