## 30-Day Content Calendar

### WEEK 1: The Problem

#### Day 1 (Monday) - Pain Point
**Platform**: All  
**Type**: Text post  
**Hook**: "Your network is dying while you scroll"

```
Your network is dying while you scroll.

That mentor who changed your career? Haven't talked in 8 months.
That client who referred you 3 people? Radio silence.
That friend from that conference? Forgot their name.

You don't have a networking problem.
You have a follow-up problem.

And it's costing you more than you realize.
```

**CTA**: None (engagement post)

---

#### Day 2 (Tuesday) - Educational
**Platform**: LinkedIn, Twitter  
**Type**: Carousel / Thread  
**Hook**: "The Warmth Score: How I rate every relationship"

```
Slide 1: The Warmth Score: How I Rate Every Relationship

Slide 2: Every contact falls into one of 4 categories:
🔥 HOT (talked this week)
🌡️ WARM (talked this month)  
❄️ COOLING (talked this quarter)
🧊 COLD (90+ days of silence)

Slide 3: The problem?
Most people have 80% of their network in COLD.
And they don't even know it.

Slide 4: Here's how to calculate yours:
- Open your messages
- Count contacts you've talked to in 30 days
- Divide by total contacts
- That's your "Warmth Rate"

Slide 5: Industry benchmarks:
- Top networkers: 15-20% warm
- Average: 5-8% warm
- Most people: Under 3%

Slide 6: The good news?
You only need 50 warm relationships to never need another cold outreach again.

Slide 7: Want help tracking your Warmth Score automatically?
[CTA: Link to waitlist]
```

#### Day 3 (Wednesday) - Story
**Platform**: All  
**Type**: Text post / Reel  
**Hook**: "I lost a $50K deal because I forgot to follow up"

```
I lost a $50K deal because I forgot to follow up.

Met someone at a conference. Great conversation.
They said "let's connect next week."

I said "definitely."

Then life happened.

3 months later, I saw their LinkedIn post:
"Excited to announce we're working with [competitor]!"

That was MY deal. I just... forgot.

That's when I realized:
My brain is not a CRM.
My memory is not reliable.
My network was dying of neglect.

Never again.
```

**CTA**: Soft - "Anyone else been there?"

---

#### Day 4 (Thursday) - Quick Win
**Platform**: All  
**Type**: Text post / Short video  
**Hook**: "The 2-minute rule that saved my network"

```
The 2-minute rule that saved my network:

Every morning, before checking email:

1. Open contacts (2 seconds)
2. Pick ONE person you haven't talked to in 90+ days (30 seconds)
3. Send them this exact message (60 seconds):

"Hey [name], I was just thinking about [specific thing]. Hope you're killing it!"

That's it.

No ask. No pitch. No agenda.

Do this for 30 days = 30 relationships revived.

Most people won't do this.
That's exactly why it works.
```

**CTA**: "Try it today. Reply with who you messaged."

---

#### Day 5 (Friday) - Poll / Engagement
**Platform**: LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram Stories  
**Type**: Poll  
**Hook**: "Be honest..."

```
Be honest:

How many people in your network have you proactively reached out to THIS MONTH?

🔘 0-2 (I'm drowning)
🔘 3-5 (Trying my best)
🔘 6-10 (Pretty consistent)
🔘 10+ (I'm a machine)
```

**Follow-up comment**: "No judgment. Most people pick the first option. That's exactly why most networks go cold."

---

#### Day 6 (Saturday) - Behind the Scenes
**Platform**: Instagram, TikTok  
**Type**: Casual video / Story  
**Hook**: "Why I'm building this"

```
[Talking head video, casual setting]

"So I'm building this app called EverReach.

And people keep asking me why.

Here's the honest answer:

I have 2,000 contacts.
I was actively talking to maybe 15.

Every time I needed an intro, a referral, or just advice...
I had to cold-message people who used to be warm.

And it felt gross.

So I'm building the thing I wish existed.

Something that just tells me: 'Hey, you haven't talked to Sarah in 3 months. Here's what to say.'

That's it. That's the whole thing.

Want early access? Link in bio."
```

---

#### Day 7 (Sunday) - Rest / Repurpose
**Platform**: Instagram Stories, Twitter  
**Type**: Repurpose best-performing post from the week  
**Hook**: "In case you missed it..."

---

### WEEK 2: The Solution

#### Day 8 (Monday) - Pain Point
**Platform**: All  
**Type**: Text post  
**Hook**: "Networking advice is broken"

```
Networking advice is broken.

"Just reach out to 10 people a day!"
"Send more LinkedIn messages!"
"Attend more events!"

This advice assumes you have infinite time.
You don't.

What you need isn't more outreach.
You need SMARTER outreach.

Reaching out to the RIGHT person.
At the RIGHT time.
With the RIGHT message.

That's not a hustle problem.
That's a systems problem.
```

**CTA**: "What's your biggest networking challenge? 👇"

---

#### Day 9 (Tuesday) - Educational
**Platform**: LinkedIn, Twitter  
**Type**: Thread / Carousel  
**Hook**: "The 50-Person Rule"

```
The 50-Person Rule (how top networkers actually network):

Thread 🧵

1/ You don't need 5,000 connections.
You need 50 relationships.

Here's the math:

2/ If you have 50 warm relationships...
And each person knows 500 people...
You're 1 introduction away from 25,000 people.

3/ The problem?
Most people try to keep 500 relationships "warm."
That's impossible.
So they all go cold.

4/ The solution:
Pick your 50.
Nurture them religiously.
Let the rest be acquaintances.

5/ How to pick your 50:
- 10 mentors (people ahead of you)
- 10 peers (people at your level)
- 10 mentees (people you can help)
- 10 connectors (people who know everyone)
- 10 wildcards (different industries)

6/ The goal:
Talk to each of your 50 at least once per quarter.
That's only 4 meaningful touchpoints per person per year.

7/ Do this consistently?
You'll never send a cold message again.

8/ Want a system that helps you track your 50?
We're building exactly that.

#### Day 10 (Wednesday) - Social Proof
**Platform**: All  
**Type**: Testimonial / Story  
**Hook**: "Sarah hadn't talked to her mentor in 2 years..."

```
Sarah hadn't talked to her mentor in 2 years.

Not because she didn't care.
Life just got busy.

Then she got a prompt:
"You haven't connected with David in 23 months. He recently posted about [topic]. Here's a message idea..."

She sent it.
15 minutes later, they were on a call.
3 weeks later, he recommended her for a board seat.

2 years of silence → 1 message → career-changing opportunity.

Your network isn't dead.
It's just waiting for you to show up.
```

**CTA**: "Who in your network needs a message today?"

---

#### Day 11 (Thursday) - Quick Win
**Platform**: All  
**Type**: Listicle / Carousel  
**Hook**: "5 non-awkward ways to reconnect with someone you ghosted"

```
5 non-awkward ways to reconnect with someone you ghosted:

2. The Shared Memory
"Was just thinking about [specific conversation/event]. Hope you're doing great!"

3. The Helpful Forward
"Saw this article and immediately thought of you: [link]"

4. The Honest Approach
"I've been meaning to reach out for months. Life got crazy. How are you?"

5. The Specific Question

The key: Be specific. Generic = ignored.

Save this for later. You'll need it.
```

#### Day 12 (Friday) - Engagement
**Platform**: LinkedIn, Twitter  
**Type**: Question post

No more forgetting.
No more guilt.
Just... actually staying in touch.

Early access link in bio if you want to try it."
```

### WEEK 3: Building Trust

#### Day 15 (Monday) - Pain Point
**Platform**: All  
**Type**: Contrast post  
**Hook**: "Two types of networkers"

```
Two types of networkers:

Type A:
- 5,000 LinkedIn connections
- Sends "just checking in" to everyone
- Gets ghosted constantly
- Wonders why opportunities don't come

Type B:
- 50 real relationships
- Knows what each person cares about
- Reaches out with intention
- Gets referrals monthly

The difference isn't charisma.
It's systems.

Which type are you building toward?
```

---

#### Day 16 (Tuesday) - Educational
**Platform**: LinkedIn, Twitter  
**Type**: Framework post  
**Hook**: "The WARM framework for never forgetting to follow up"

```
The WARM framework for never forgetting to follow up:

W - Who
Pick your top 50 relationships to nurture.

A - Alerts
Set reminders for each (monthly, quarterly, etc.)

R - Reason
Never reach out empty-handed. Have a reason.

M - Memory
Track what you talked about. Reference it next time.

Most CRMs are built for sales.
This is built for humans.
```

---

#### Day 17 (Wednesday) - Social Proof
**Platform**: All  
**Type**: Results post  
**Hook**: "30 days of intentional outreach"

```
30 days of intentional outreach. Here's what happened:

Week 1: Felt awkward. Sent 7 messages.
Week 2: Getting easier. 2 people responded with "perfect timing!"
Week 3: Someone referred me a client. Unprompted.
Week 4: A dormant mentor offered to make an intro I'd wanted for years.

Total messages sent: 28
Relationships revived: 12
Opportunities created: 3

The ROI on following up is insane.
But most people never start.
```

---

#### Day 18 (Thursday) - Quick Win
**Platform**: All  
**Type**: Template post  
**Hook**: "Steal my follow-up template"

```
Steal my follow-up template:

Subject: [Specific reference]

"Hey [Name],

[One sentence about something specific to them - recent post, shared memory, mutual connection]

[One sentence about why you're reaching out now]

[Simple, low-friction ask OR no ask at all]

[Your name]"

Example:

"Hey Marcus,

Just saw your post about the product launch - congrats! Reminded me of our conversation about scaling teams last year.

Been thinking about you and wanted to check in.

How's everything going?

- [Name]"

That's it. Simple > clever.
```

---

#### Day 19 (Friday) - Engagement
**Platform**: All  
**Type**: Hot take  
**Hook**: "The best networkers I know..."

The best networkers I know don't "network."

---

### WEEK 4: Conversion Push

#### Day 22 (Monday) - Pain Point (Urgency)
**Platform**: All  
**Type**: Text post  
**Hook**: "The people you're not talking to..."

```
The people you're not talking to are talking to someone else.

Your old clients → now someone else's clients.
Your mentors → now mentoring someone else.
Your warm leads → now cold.

Every day you don't follow up, your network shrinks.

Not because they forgot you.
Because you forgot them.
```

---

#### Day 23 (Tuesday) - Educational
**Platform**: LinkedIn, Twitter  
**Type**: Carousel  
**Hook**: "The hidden cost of a cold network"

```
Slide 1: The Hidden Cost of a Cold Network

Slide 2: Every cold relationship = 
A door that's now harder to open

Slide 3: The math:
- 1 warm intro > 100 cold emails
- Referred candidates: 4x more likely to be hired
- Referred deals: 2x higher close rate

Slide 4: But here's the problem:
You can't get warm intros from cold relationships.

Slide 5: The solution isn't "network more."
It's "nurture what you have."

Slide 6: We're building a system for exactly this.
Early access: [link]
```

"Closed my biggest deal ever from a 'dead' contact." - Chris

Your network has more value than you realize.
You just need a system to unlock it.

```
[Authentic talking head]

"People ask why I'm building EverReach.

Honestly? I was tired of being bad at staying in touch.

I'd meet amazing people, have great conversations...
And then never talk to them again.

Not because I didn't care.
Because I didn't have a system.

So I built one.

And now I want to give it to everyone who feels the same way.

Early access: link in bio."
