# EverReach Privacy Policy

Effective date: 2026-02-09

EverReach (“we”, “our”, “us”) is an AI‑enhanced personal CRM. This policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your choices.

We value privacy. We do not sell personal data.

---

## Data We Collect

- **Account Information**
  - Email address, display name
  - Authentication events
- **Contacts (Optional)**
  - Imported contacts (names, emails/phones), notes you add, tags/interests
  - You control which contacts you import; you can delete them at any time
- **Purchases**
  - Subscription status and receipts (via RevenueCat / Apple / Google)
- **Usage & Analytics**
  - App events and performance metrics (e.g., feature usage, crash reports)
  - Pseudonymous identifiers for analytics
- **Device & Technical**
  - OS/version, app version, language, timestamps, IP (for security/anti‑abuse)

We do not collect precise location, address book without permission, or microphone data except when you explicitly record a voice note.

---

## How We Use Data

- Provide and improve app features (contacts, notes, search, AI context)
- Manage subscriptions and trials
- Maintain security, prevent abuse, and ensure reliability
- Analyze usage to prioritize improvements and fix issues
- Measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns (with your consent)
- Provide support when you contact us

---

## Legal Bases (EEA/UK)

- Performance of a contract (to deliver the app)
- Legitimate interests (security, product improvement)
- Consent (where required, e.g., tracking permissions, advertising attribution)

---

## Data Sharing

We share data with service providers to operate and improve the app:

- **Supabase**: hosting, authentication, storage, database
- **RevenueCat / Apple / Google**: subscriptions and purchase validation
- **PostHog**: product analytics (pseudonymous event data)
- **Meta (Facebook) Conversions API**: ad measurement and attribution (see Advertising & Attribution below)
- **Error/Performance tools**: diagnostics and crash reporting

These providers process data on our behalf under agreements consistent with this policy.

We do not sell personal data.

---

## Advertising & Attribution

With your consent (via Apple's App Tracking Transparency prompt on iOS), we share certain data with **Meta Platforms (Facebook)** through their Conversions API to measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns. This data is used solely for ad attribution and measurement — not for building advertising profiles or retargeting.

**Data shared with Meta (when you grant permission):**
- Hashed email address, phone number, and name (SHA‑256; Meta cannot read the original values)
- Hashed city, state, zip code, and country
- A device‑level app identifier (fbp)
- Click identifiers from Facebook ads you may have tapped (fbc)
- App event data (e.g., sign‑up, subscription, screen views)

**Data NOT shared with Meta:**
- Your contacts, notes, voice recordings, or CRM content
- Precise location
- Any data if you deny the tracking permission prompt

If you deny tracking permission, we still send anonymous, aggregate event counts to Meta (without any user‑identifying information) so we can measure overall campaign performance.

You can change your tracking preference at any time in **iOS Settings → Privacy & Security → Tracking**.

---

## Data Retention

We retain data while your account is active. You can request deletion; upon account deletion, we delete or anonymize personal data subject to legal obligations (e.g., transaction records).

---

## Your Rights

Depending on your region (e.g., GDPR/CCPA), you may have the right to:

- Access, correct, or delete your data
- Port your data
- Object to or restrict certain processing
- Withdraw consent where processing is based on consent

To exercise rights, contact: privacy@everreach.app

---

## Security

We use encryption in transit, access controls, and other safeguards. No method is 100% secure; we continually improve protections.

---

## Children

EverReach is not intended for children under 16. We do not knowingly collect data from children.

---

## International Transfers

We may process data outside your country. Where required, we use appropriate safeguards (e.g., SCCs).

---

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy as our app evolves. We will indicate the effective date and, where material, provide notice in‑app or by email.
