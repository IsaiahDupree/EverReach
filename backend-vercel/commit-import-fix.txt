fix: remove non-existent getServiceSupabaseClient import

The function doesn't exist in lib/supabase.ts - only getServiceClient
and getSupabaseServiceClient exist. The file CRUD endpoint doesn't
actually need this import, removed it to fix build error.

Error was:
Type error: '"@/lib/supabase"' has no exported member named 
'getServiceSupabaseClient'. Did you mean 'getServiceClient'?
