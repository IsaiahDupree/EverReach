feat: restructure backend tests to follow agent test pattern

Following the proven test structure from test/agent/, implemented:

Unified Test Infrastructure:
- test/backend/_shared.mjs - Shared utilities (getAccessToken, apiFetch, reporting)
- test/backend/run-all.mjs - Unified test runner with comprehensive reporting
- Moved tests to test/backend/ directory for organization

Key Features:
- Individual test reports with detailed results
- Unified report combining all test outputs
- Markdown reports in test/backend/reports/
- Consistent error logging and stack traces
- Performance metrics tracking (duration per test)
- Success rate calculations
- Test RUN_ID for correlating reports

Test Structure:
- Each test generates its own detailed report
- Runner combines all reports into unified view
- Failed tests shown first in reports
- Complete environment info logged
- Follows same pattern as agent tests for consistency

Files Created/Modified:
- test/backend/_shared.mjs (shared utilities, 170 lines)
- test/backend/run-all.mjs (unified runner, 280 lines)
- test/backend/file-crud.mjs (refactored to use _shared)
- test/backend/revenuecat-webhook.mjs (moved from test/)
- scripts/test-file-crud.ps1 (updated to use unified runner)

Benefits:
- Consistent test infrastructure across codebase
- Better debugging with detailed error logs
- Comprehensive reporting for CI/CD
- Easy to add new tests (just drop .mjs files in test/backend/)
- Automatic report generation

Run tests: node test/backend/run-all.mjs
Or via script: .\scripts\test-file-crud.ps1
