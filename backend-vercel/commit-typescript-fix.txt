fix(ci): pin typescript to ^5.6.3 to resolve Vercel build failures

TypeScript ~5.8.3 does not exist on npm registry and was causing
'No matching version found' errors during Vercel deployment.

Changed to stable version ^5.6.3 which is compatible with:
- Next.js 14.2.10
- Node 18-20 (per package.json engines)
- All existing type definitions

This should resolve the build failures and allow successful deployment
of the RevenueCat webhook and file CRUD endpoints.
