### Question Flow Strategy

**Pacing:**
- Q1-5: Fast (30 sec) - Easy warmup, no commitment
- Q6-10: Medium (60 sec) - Problem validation, introduce pain
- Q11-15: Medium (60 sec) - Solution introduction, feature education
- Q16-18: Careful (45 sec) - Trust building, privacy
- Q19-20: Action (30 sec) - Get started, create first contact

**Total time: ~3.5 minutes** (feels like 2 min with good UI/animations)

**Psychology:**
- Start easy (name, feelings)
- Build awareness (pain points)
- Introduce solution gradually
- Address objections head-on
- End with action (aha moment setup)

**Skip Strategy:**
- Allow "Skip" on Q6, Q10, Q14, Q19, Q20
- Never force anything that feels invasive
- "I'll decide later" options for privacy questions

**Data Captured:**
- Segment: business | networking | personal (Q7)
- Goal: close deals | land opportunity | reconnect | consistency (Q8)
- Cadence preference: weekly | biweekly | monthly | quarterly (Q12)
- Channels: SMS | Email | Call | DM platforms (Q13)
- AI comfort: help write | just remind | mix (Q14)
- Privacy mode: enabled | disabled (Q17)
- Analytics consent: yes | no (Q18)
- First contact: name (Q20) → drives personalized demo

---
