# Integrations Docs Index

Centralized guides for configuring external integrations with the EverReach backend.

- RevenueCat
  - `REVENUECAT_WEBHOOK_SETUP.md` — Webhook URL, security (Signature or Authorization), required envs, migration, and E2E testing.
- PostHog
  - `POSTHOG_INTEGRATION.md` — Region/API keys, canonical event names (fill-in list), properties schema, and verification checklist.

Future integrations to add here:
- Stripe (Checkout/Webhooks)
- Resend (Email)
- Expo Push Notifications
- Feature Flags / Experiments

Conventions:
- Keep docs in this folder focused and task-based.
- Use checklists and explicit fill-in sections for secrets and event names.
- Mirror the schema-first + unified test runner workflow where applicable.
